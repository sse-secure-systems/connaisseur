<!-- # Connaisseur -->

A Kubernetes admission controller to integrate container image signature verification and trust pinning into a cluster.

:tada: **Connaisseur 2.0 is out now! Find more information on new features in our [announcement](https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur/discussions/187)** :tada:

**:point_right: The full documentation is available [here](https://sse-secure-systems.github.io/connaisseur/) :book:**

**:point_right: Feel free to reach out via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur/discussions) :speech_balloon:**

## What is Connaisseur?

Connaisseur ensures integrity and provenance of container images in a Kubernetes cluster.
To do so, it intercepts resource creation or update requests sent to the Kubernetes cluster, identifies all container images and verifies their signatures against pre-configured public keys.
Based on the result, it either accepts or denies those requests.

Connaisseur is developed under three core values: *Security*, *Usability*, *Compatibility*.
It is built to be extendable and currently aims to support the following signing solutions:

- [Notary V1](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary) / [Docker Content Trust](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/)
- [Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/) / [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) (EXPERIMENTAL)
- [Notary V2](https://github.com/notaryproject/nv2) (PLANNED)

It provides several additional features:

- [Detection Mode](docs/features/detection_mode.md): *warn but do not block invalid images*
- [Namespaced Validation](docs/features/namespaced_validation.md): *restrict validation to dedicated namespaces*
- [Alerting](docs/features/alerting.md): *send alerts based on verification result*


## Quick Start

Getting started to verify image signatures is only a matter of minutes:

> :warning: Only try this out on a test cluster as deployments with unsigned images will be blocked. :warning:

Connaisseur comes pre-configured with public keys for its own repository and [Docker's official images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/) (official images can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image&image_filter=official)).
It can be fully configured via `helm/values.yaml`.
For a quick start, clone the Connaisseur repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git
```

Next, install Connaisseur via [Helm](https://helm.sh):

```bash
helm install connaisseur helm --atomic --create-namespace --namespace connaisseur
```

Once installation has finished, you are good to go.
Successful verification can be tested via official Docker images like `hello-world`:

```bash
kubectl run hello-world --image=docker.io/hello-world
```

Or our signed `testimage`:

```bash
kubectl run demo --image=docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:signed
```

Both will return `pod/<name> created`. However, when trying to deploy an unsigned image:

```bash
kubectl run demo --image=docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:unsigned
```

Connaisseur denies the request and returns an error `(...) Unable to find signed digest (...)`. Since the images above are signed using Docker Content Trust, you can inspect the trust data using `docker trust inspect --pretty <image-name>`.

To uninstall Connaisseur use:

```bash
helm uninstall connaisseur --namespace connaisseur
```

To uninstall all components add the `--purge` flag.

Congrats :tada: you just validated the first images in your cluster!
To get started configuring and verifying your own images and signatures, please follow our [setup guide](https://sse-secure-systems.github.io/connaisseur/latest/getting_started/).
