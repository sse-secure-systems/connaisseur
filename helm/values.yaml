### VALIDATORS ###
# validators are a set of configurations (types, public keys, authentication)
# that can be used for validating one or multiple images (or image signatures).
# they are tied to their respective image(s) via the image policy below. there
# are a few handy validators pre-configured.
validators:
# static validator that allows each image
- name: allow
  type: static
  approve: true
# static validator that denies each image
- name: deny
  type: static
  approve: false
# the `default` validator is used if no validator is specified in image policy
- name: default
  type: notaryv1  # or other supported validator (e.g. "cosign")
  host: notary.docker.io # in case of notaryv1, configure the notary server to be used
  trust_roots:
  # # the `default` key is used if no key is specified in image policy
  #- name: default
  #  key: |  # enter your public key below
  #    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  #    <add your public key here>
  #    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  #cert: |  # in case the trust data host is using a selfsigned certificate
  #  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  #  ...
  #  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  #auth:  # credentials in case the trust data requires authentication
  #  # either (preferred solution)
  #  secret_name: mysecret  # reference a k8s secret in the form required by the validator type (check the docs)
  #  # or (only for notaryv1 validator)
  #  username: myuser
  #  password: mypass
# pre-configured nv1 validator for public notary from Docker Hub
- name: dockerhub_basics
  type: notaryv1
  host: notary.docker.io
  trust_roots:
    # public key for official docker images (https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image&image_filter=official)
    # !if not needed feel free to remove the key!
  - name: docker_official

### IMAGE POLICY ###
# the image policy ties validators and images together whereby always only the most specific rule (pattern)
# is applied. specify if and how images should be validated by which validator via the validator name.
policy:
- pattern: "*:*"
- pattern: "docker.io/library/*:*"
  validator: dockerhub_basics
  with:
    trust_root: docker_official
- pattern: "k8s.gcr.io/*:*"
  validator: allow
- pattern: "docker.io/securesystemsengineering/*:*"
  validator: dockerhub_basics
  with:
    trust_root: securesystemsengineering_official

# in detection mode, deployment will not be denied, but only prompted

# namespaced validation allows to restrict the namespaces that will be subject to Connaisseur verification.
# when enabled, based on namespaced validation mode ('ignore' or 'validate')
# - either all namespaces with label "securesystemsengineering.connaisseur/webhook=ignore" are ignored
# - or only namespaces with label "securesystemsengineering.connaisseur/webhook=validate" are validated.
# warning: enabling namespaced validation, allows roles with edit permission on a namespace to disable
# validation for that namespace

# alerting is implemented in form of simple POST requests with json payload
# you can use and/or adapt the predefined Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase templates and the examples below
# to channel alert notifications to Slack/OpsGenie/Keybase or create a custom template for a customized alert
# payload to use with a simple POST request to the receiver_url to receive alerts.
# Parameters you can use in your templates are "alert_message", "priority", "connaisseur_pod_id", "cluster",
# "timestamp", "request_id" and "images" each one basically meaning what their names indicate
