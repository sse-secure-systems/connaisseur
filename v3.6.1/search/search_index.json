On a very basic level, this requires two steps:</p> <ol> <li>Signing container images after building</li> <li>Verifying the image signatures before deployment</li> </ol> <p>Connaisseur aims to solve step two. This is achieved by implementing several validators, i.e. configurable signature verification modules for different signing solutions (e.g. Notary V1). While the detailed security considerations mainly depend on the applied solution, Connaisseur in general verifies the signature over the container image content against a trust anchor or trust root (e.g. public key) and thus let's you ensure that images have not been tampered with (integrity) and come from a valid source (provenance).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#trusted-digests","title":"Trusted digests","text":"<p>But what is actually verified? Container images can be referenced in two different ways based on their registry, repository, image name (<code>&lt;registry&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;/&lt;image name&gt;</code>) followed by either tag or digest:</p> <ul> <li>tag: docker.io/library/nginx:1.20.1</li> <li>digest: docker.io/library/nginx@sha256:af9c...69ce</li> </ul> <p>While the tag is a mutable, human readable description, the digest is an immutable, inherent property of the image, namely the SHA256 hash of its content. This also means that a tag can correspond to varying digests whereas digests are unique for each image. The container runtime (e.g. containerd) compares the image content with the received digest before spinning up the container. As a result, Connaisseur just needs to make sure that only trusted digests (signed by a trusted entity) are passed to the container runtime. Depending on how an image for deployment is referenced, it will either attempt to translate the tag to a trusted digest or validate whether the digest is trusted. How the digest is signed in detail, where the signature is stored, what it is verfied against and how different image distribution and updating attacks are mitigated depends on the signature solutions.</p>"},{"location":"#mutating-admission-controller","title":"Mutating admission controller","text":"<p>How to validate images before deployment to a cluster? The Kubernetes API is the fundamental fabric behind the control plane. It allows operators and cluster components to communicate with each other and, for example, query, create, modify or delete Kubernetes resources. Each request passes through several phases such as authentication and authorization before it is persisted to etcd. Among those phases are two steps of admission control: mutating and validating admission. In those phases the API sends admission requests to configured webhooks (admission controllers) and receives admission responses (admit, deny, or modify). Connaisseur uses a mutating admission webhook, as requests are not only admitted or denied based on the validation result but might also require modification of contained images referenced by tags to trusted digests. The webhook is configured to only forward resource creation or update requests to the Connaisseur service running inside the cluster, since only deployments of images to the cluster are relevant for signature verification. This allows Connaisseur to intercept requests before deployment and based on the validation:</p> <ul> <li>admit if all images are referenced by trusted digests</li> <li>modify if all images can be translated to trusted digests</li> <li>deny if at least one of the requested images does not have a trusted digest</li> </ul> <p></p>"},{"location":"#image-policy-and-validators","title":"Image policy and validators","text":"<p>Now, how does Connaisseur process admission requests? A newly received request is first inspected for container image references that need to be validated (1). The resulting list of images referenced by tag or digest is passed to the image policy (2). The image policy matches the identified images to the configured validators and corresponding trust roots (e.g. public keys) to be used for verification. Image policy and validator configuration form the central logic behind Connaisseur and are described in detail und basics. Validation is the step where the actual signature verification takes place (3). For each image, the required trust data is retrieved from external sources such as Notary server, registry or sigstore transparency log and validated against the pre-configured trust root (e.g. public key). This forms the basis for deciding on the request (4). In case no trusted digest is found for any of the images (i.e. either no signed digest available or no signature matching the public key), the whole request is denied. Otherwise, Connaisseur translates all image references in the original request to trusted digests and admits it (5).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#compatibility","title":"Compatibility","text":"<p>Supported signature solutions and configuration options are documented under validators.</p> <p>Connaisseur supports Kubernets v1.16 and higher.

If you mistrust the Docker Notary server, the default configuration is vulnerable as it contains a <code>notaryv1</code> validator with the root keys of both Connaisseur and the library of official Docker images."},{"location":"SECURITY/#reporting-a-vulnerability","title":"Reporting a vulnerability","text":"<p>We are very grateful for reports on vulnerabilities discovered in the project, specifically as it is intended to increase security for the community.

It intercepts all CREATE and UPDATE resource requests for Pods, Deployments, ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, and CronJobs and extracts all image references for validation.</p> <p>Per default, Connaisseur uses automatic child approval by which the child of a Kubernetes resource is automatically admitted without re-verification of the signature in order to avoid duplicate validation and handle inconsistencies with the image policy. Essentially, this is done since an image that is deployed as part of an already deployed object (e.g. a Pod deployed as a child of a Deployment) has already been validated and potentially mutated during admission of the parent. More information and configuration options can be found in the feature documentation for automatic child approval.</p> <p>Validation itself relies on two core concepts: image policy and validators. A validator is a set of configuration options required for validation like the type of signature, public key to use for verification, path to signature data, or authentication. The image policy defines a set of rules which maps different images to those validators. This is done via glob matching of the image name which for example allows to use different validators for different registries, repositories, images or even tags. This is specifically useful when using public or external images from other entities like Docker's official images or different keys in a more complex development team.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Typically, the public key of a known entity is used to validate the signature over an image's content in order to ensure integrity and provenance.

Since not every application logic works with every Helm chart version, we now default to using the tag equal to the chart's <code>appVersion</code> (prepended with <code>v</code>) and explicitly discourage setting (and do not support arbitrary combinations of) <code>kubernetes.deployment.image.tag</code>. However, having this key, and taking into account the top-level <code>kubernetes</code> key, the repository (or more correctly, registry, namespace and repository) are configured as <code>kubernetes.deployment.image.repository</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Top-level <code>application</code> key<ul> <li>Previously, we had a host of configuration keys that pertained to the actual configuration of the Connaisseur application, e.g. the log level, which validators were configured and which features are enabled.

Since the main interaction of users is through the Helm <code>values.yaml</code>, having inconsistent casing there is worse than dealing with a few misnamed keys in our Python stack. Accordingly, we migrated all configuration keys_with_snake_case to dromedaryKeys.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Group features in <code>features</code> key<ul> <li>Previously, we had top-level configurations for all features changing Connaisseur's verification behavior. We grouped them below a common <code>features</code> key below the new <code>application</code> key.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consistent feature toggles<ul> <li>Previously, some features had an <code>enable</code> key, while others simply featured a boolean. The idea was based around whether the feature would have further configuration or not. However, having configuration for a disabled feature doesn't really make sense, so we changed it to be the following:<ul> <li>If a feature has configuration, i.e. <code>&lt;featureName&gt;.&lt;someConfigKey&gt;</code> is set, it is enabled.</li> <li>If a feature is set, i.e. <code>&lt;featureName&gt;: true</code> it is enabled and an error is thrown if it needs configuration but doesn't have any.</li> <li>If a feature is false, i.e. <code>&lt;featureName&gt;: false</code> it is disabled.</li> <li>If a feature is not set at all, i.e. <code>features</code> doesn't have a <code>&lt;featureName&gt;</code> key, its default configuration is chosen.</li> <li>If a feature has no configuration, i.e. <code>&lt;featureName&gt;: true</code>, the only allowed values are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Otherwise an error is thrown at time of deployment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Alerting <code>receivers</code><ul> <li>We renamed <code>alerting.templates</code> to <code>alerting.receivers</code> as each receiver has inherently a template and multiple receivers can have the same template. As such <code>templates</code> wasn't a fitting name.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cosign validator <code>host.rekor</code> key<ul> <li>Previously, a Cosign validator could have a <code>host</code> key, which determined the remote host of a Rekor transparency log to validate against. Since <code>host</code> is both imprecise for this use and may be used in the future for other hosts (e.g. keyless) for the same validator, we moved this value to a subkey <code>host.rekor</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"threat_model/","title":"Threat Model","text":"<p>DEPRECATION WARNING</p> <p>The threat model is OUTDATED and does not reflect the currently applicable architecture.

That way, the functionality of Connaisseur could be completely disabled or altered at will. RBAC: By only permitting a carefully selected group of people to start and stop services in the Connaisseur namespace, such attacks can be prevented. Tampering Given an attacker has access to the Connaisseur container, she could tamper with its source code, leading to forged responses or full compromise. The attacker could also stop the the original Connaisseur process and handle incoming requests some other way, which would be similar to the spoofing threat, but from inside the Connaisseur container. RBAC + Monitoring: Access to the inside of the container can be restricted with RBAC, so an attacker never gets there in the first place. In case the attacker already is inside the container, there are specific monitoring tools (e.g. falco), which are able to register changes inside containers and notify you, should Connaisseur be compromised. Tampering An attacker could modify Connaisseur's image policy to bypass signature verification and inject malicious images. Alternatively, the public root key could be replaced, allowing fake trust data to pass as legit. Lastly, the admission controller could be simply deactivated by deleting the webhook. RBAC + Monitoring: An RBAC system can prevent unauthorized changes to both the image policy and public root key. Additionally, the Connaisseur readiness probe checks the availability of the webhook and will be set to <code>Not Ready</code> should the webhook not be present. Monitoring should still be used to keep track of the admission controller's webhook availability status, as setting up a fake <code>connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel</code> pod in the <code>connaisseur</code> namespace can bypass that readiness probe check. More on that in an upcoming architectural decision record. Denial of service When sending an extraordinary amount of requests to Connaisseur or triggering unexpected behavior, Connaisseur might become unresponsive or crash. As a result, image signatures can't be verified. Failure Policy: The webhook that is connected to Connaisseur denies all request automatically, should the Connaisseur service be unavailable. Thus, malicious images cannot enter the cluster. Additionally, multiple instances of Connaisseur can be run for better load balancing. Elevation of privilege Since Connaisseur interacts with the Kubernetes API, an attacker located inside the Connaisseur container can act on its behalf and use its permissions. RBAC: Per default, the Connaisseur service account only has read permissions to a few non-critical objects."},{"location":"threat_model/#3-notary-server","title":"(3) Notary server","text":"Threat Description Counter Measure Spoofing An attacker could mount a Monster-in-the-Middle attack between Notary and the Connaisseur service and act as a fake Notary, sending back false trust data.

If not and  <code>FailurePolicy</code> is set to <code>Fail</code>, the webhook will block anything and everything, including the Connaisseur pods themselves. This means, the webhook must be installed after the Connaisseur pods are ready. This was previously solved using the <code>post-install</code> Helm hook, which installs the webhook configuration after all other resources have been applied and are considered ready. Just for installation purposes, this solution suffices. A downside of this is, every resource installed via a Helm hook isn't natively considered to be part of the chart, meaning a <code>helm uninstall</code> would completely ignore those resources and leave the webhook configuration in place. Then the situation of everything and anything being blocked arises again. Additionally, upgrading won't be possible, since you can't tell Helm to temporarily delete resources and then reapply them. That's why the <code>helm-hook</code> image and <code>bootstrap-sentinel</code> where introduced. They were used to temporarily delete the webhook and reapply it before and after installations, in order to beat the race conditions.

Additionally, during the <code>post-install</code> (and <code>post-upgrade</code>/<code>post-rollback</code>) Helm hook, the webhook will be updated so it can actually intercept incoming request. So in a sense an unloaded webhook gets installed, which then gets \"armed\" during <code>post-install</code>.

This behavior can be configured or even disabled.</p> <p>When automatic child approval is enabled, images that are deployed as part of already deployed objects (e.g. a Pod deployed as a child of a Deployment) are already validated and potentially mutated during admission of the parent. In consequence, the images of child resources are directly admitted without re-verification of the signature. This is done as the parent (and thus the child) has already been validated and might have been mutated, which would lead to duplicate validation and could cause image policy pattern mismatch. For example, given a Deployment which contains Pods with <code>image:tag</code> that gets mutated to contain Pods with <code>image@sha256:digest</code>. Then a) the Pod would not need another validation as the image was validated during the admittance of the Deployment and b) if there exists a specific rule with pattern <code>image:tag</code> and another less specific rule with <code>image*</code>, then after mutating the Deployment, the Pod would be falsely validated against <code>image*</code> instead of <code>image:tag</code>. To ensure the child resource is legit in this case, the parent resource is requested via the Kubernetes API and only those images it lists are accepted.</p> <p>When automatic child approval is disabled, Connaisseur only validates and potentially mutates Pod resources.</p> <p>There is trade-offs between the two behaviors: With automatic child approval, Connaisseur only verifies that the image reference in a child resource is the same as in the parent. This means that resources deployed prior to Connaisseur will never be validated until they are re-deployed even if a corresponding Pod is restarted. Consequently, a restarting Pod with an expired signature would still be admitted. However, this avoids unexpected failures when restarting Pods, avoids inconsistencies with the image policy and reduces the number of validations and thus the load.

What happens in the background is that Connaisseur looks up trust data of the image in the <code>root</code>, <code>snapshot</code>, <code>timestamp</code> and <code>targets</code> files (in json format) by querying the API of the Notary server. Trust data syntax is validated against their known schemas and the files' signatures are validated against their respective public keys.

To better understand this feature, it's best to have a basic understanding of the TUF key hierarchy, or more specifically the purpose of the root, targets and delegation keys. If you are more interested in this topic, please read the TUF documentation.</p> <p>When creating the signatures of your docker images earlier, two keys were generated -- the root key and the targets key. The root key is the root of all trust and will be used whenever a new image repository is created and needs to be signed. It's also used to rotate all other kinds of keys, thus there is usually only one root key present. The targets key is needed for new signatures on one specific image repository, hence every image repository has its own targets key. Hierarchically speaking, the targets keys are below the root key, as the root key can be used to rotate the targets keys should they get compromised.</p> <p>Delegations will now go one level deeper, meaning they can be used to sign individual image repositories and only need the targets key for rotation purposes, instead of the root key. Also delegation keys are not bound to individual image repositories, so they can be re-used multiple times over different image repositories. So in a sense they can be understood as keys for individual signers.</p> <p>To create a delegation key run:</p> <pre><code>docker trust key generate &lt;key-name&gt;\n&gt; Generating key for &lt;key-name&gt;...\n&gt; Enter passphrase for new &lt;key-name&gt; key with ID 9deed25:\n&gt; Repeat passphrase for new &lt;key-name&gt; key with ID 9deed25:\n&gt; Successfully generated and loaded private key. Corresponding public key available: &lt;current-directory&gt;/&lt;key-name&gt;.pub\n</code></pre> <p>This delegation key now needs to be added as a signer to a respective image repository, like the <code>busybox</code> example above. In doing so, you'll be asked for the targets key.</p> <pre><code>docker trust signer add --key &lt;key-name&gt;.pub &lt;key-name&gt; &lt;your-repo&gt;/busybox\n&gt; Adding signer \"&lt;key-name&gt;\" to &lt;your-repo&gt;/busybox...\n&gt; Enter passphrase for repository key with ID b0014f8:\n&gt; Successfully added signer: &lt;key-name&gt; to &lt;your-repo&gt;/busybox\n</code></pre> <p>If you create a new signature for the image, you'll be asked for your delegation key instead of the targets key, therefore creating a signature using the delegation.</p> <pre><code>DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 docker push &lt;your-repo&gt;/busybox:stable\n</code></pre> <p>Without further configuration, Connaisseur will accept all delegation signatures for an image that can ultimately be validated against the public root key. Connaisseur can enforce a certain signer/delegation (or multiple) for an image's signature via the <code>with.delegations</code> list inside an image policy rule. Simply add the signer's name to the list.
