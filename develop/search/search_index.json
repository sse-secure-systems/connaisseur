What is Connaisseur? \u2693\ufe0e Connaisseur ensures integrity and provenance of container images in a Kubernetes cluster. To do so, it intercepts resource creation or update requests sent to the Kubernetes cluster, identifies all container images and verifies their signatures against pre-configured public keys. Based on the result, it either accepts or denies those requests. Connaisseur is developed under three core values: Security , Usability , Compatibility . It is built to be extendable and currently aims to support the following signing solutions: Notary (V1) / Docker Content Trust sigstore / Cosign Notary V2 (PLANNED) It provides several additional features: Detection Mode : warn but do not block invalid images Namespaced Validation : restrict validation to dedicated namespaces Alerting : send alerts based on verification result Feel free to reach out via GitHub Discussions ! Quick start \u2693\ufe0e Getting started to verify image signatures is only a matter of minutes: Only try this out on a test cluster as deployments with unsigned images will be blocked. Connaisseur comes pre-configured with public keys for its own repository and Docker's official images (official images can be found here ). It can be fully configured via helm/values.yaml . For a quick start, clone the Connaisseur repository: git clone https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git Next, install Connaisseur via Helm : helm install connaisseur helm --atomic --create-namespace --namespace connaisseur Once installation has finished, you are good to go. Successful verification can be tested via official Docker images like hello-world : kubectl run hello-world --image = docker.io/hello-world Or our signed testimage : kubectl run demo --image = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:signed Both will return pod/<name> created . However, when trying to deploy an unsigned image: kubectl run demo --image = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:unsigned Connaisseur denies the request and returns an error (...) Unable to find signed digest (...) . Since the images above are signed using Docker Content Trust, you can inspect the trust data using docker trust inspect --pretty <image-name> . To uninstall Connaisseur use: helm uninstall connaisseur --namespace connaisseur Congrats you just validated the first images in your cluster! To get started configuring and verifying your own images and signatures, please follow our setup guide . How does it work? \u2693\ufe0e Integrity and provenance of container images deployed to a Kubernetes cluster can be ensured via digital signatures. On a very basic level, this requires two steps: Signing container images after building Verifying the image signatures before deployment Connaisseur aims to solve step two. This is achieved by implementing several validators , i.e. configurable signature verification modules for different signing solutions (e.g. Notary V1). While the detailed security considerations mainly depend on the applied solution, Connaisseur in general verifies the signature over the container image content against a trust anchor or trust root (e.g. public key) and thus let's you ensure that images have not been tampered with (integrity) and come from a valid source (provenance). Trusted digests \u2693\ufe0e But what is actually verified? Container images can be referenced in two different ways based on their registry, repository, image name ( <registry>/<repository>/<image name> ) followed by either tag or digest: tag: docker.io/library/nginx: 1.20.1 digest: docker.io/library/nginx@ sha256:af9c...69ce While the tag is a mutable, human readable description, the digest is an immutable, inherent property of the image, namely the SHA256 hash of its content. This also means that a tag can correspond to varying digests whereas digests are unique for each image. The container runtime (e.g. containerd) compares the image content with the received digest before spinning up the container. As a result, Connaisseur just needs to make sure that only trusted digests (signed by a trusted entity) are passed to the container runtime. Depending on how an image for deployment is referenced, it will either attempt to translate the tag to a trusted digest or validate whether the digest is trusted. How the digest is signed in detail, where the signature is stored, what it is verfied against and how different image distribution and updating attacks are mitigated depends on the signature solutions. Mutating admission controller \u2693\ufe0e How to validate images before deployment to a cluster? The Kubernetes API is the fundamental fabric behind the control plane. It allows operators and cluster components to communicate with each other and, for example, query, create, modify or delete Kubernetes resources. Each request passes through several phases such as authentication and authorization before it is persisted to etcd . Among those phases are two steps of admission control : mutating and validating admission. In those phases the API sends admission requests to configured webhooks (admission controllers) and receives admission responses (admit, deny, or modify). Connaisseur uses a mutating admission webhook, as requests are not only admitted or denied based on the validation result but might also require modification of contained images referenced by tags to trusted digests. The webhook is configured to only forward resource creation or update requests to the Connaisseur service running inside the cluster, since only deployments of images to the cluster are relevant for signature verification. This allows Connaisseur to intercept requests before deployment and based on the validation: admit if all images are referenced by trusted digests modify if all images can be translated to trusted digests deny if at least one of the requested images does not have a trusted digest Image policy and validators \u2693\ufe0e Now, how does Connaisseur process admission requests? A newly received request is first inspected for container image references that need to be validated (1). The resulting list of images referenced by tag or digest is passed to the image policy (2). The image policy matches the identified images to the configured validators and corresponding trust roots (e.g. public keys) to be used for verification. Image policy and validator configuration form the central logic behind Connaisseur and are described in detail und basics . Validation is the step where the actual signature verification takes place (3). For each image, the required trust data is retrieved from external sources such as Notary server, registry or sigstore transparency log and validated against the pre-configured trust root (e.g. public key). This forms the basis for deciding on the request (4). In case no trusted digest is found for any of the images (i.e. either no signed digest available or no signature matching the public key), the whole request is denied. Otherwise, Connaisseur translates all image references in the original request to trusted digests and admits it (5). Compatibility \u2693\ufe0e Supported signature solutions and configuration options are documented under validators . Connaisseur is expected to be compatible with most Kubernetes services. It has been successfully tested with: K3s \u2705 kind \u2705 MicroK8s \u2705 (enable DNS addon via sudo microk8s enable dns ) minikube \u2705 Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) \u2705 Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) \u2705 Google Kubernetes Engine \u2705 SysEleven MetaKube \u2705 All registry interactions use the OCI Distribution Specification that is based on the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 which is the standard for all common image registries. For using Notary (V1) as a signature solution, only some registries provide the required Notary server attached to the registry with e.g. shared authentication. Connaisseur has been tested with the following Notary (V1) supporting image registries: Docker Hub \u2705 Harbor \u2705 Azure Container Registry (ACR) \u2705 (check our configuration notes ) In case you identify any incompatibilities, please create an issue Versions \u2693\ufe0e The latest stable version of Connaisseur is available on the master branch. Releases follow semantic versioning standards to facilitate compatibility. For each release, a signed container image tagged with the version is published in the Connaisseur Docker Hub repository . Latest developments are available on the develop branch, but should be considered unstable and no pre-built container image is provided. Development \u2693\ufe0e Connaisseur is open source and open development. We try to make major changes transparent via Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and announce developments via GitHub Discussions . Information on responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and tracking of past findings is available in the Security Policy . Bug reports should be filed as GitHub issues to share status and potential fixes with other users.

We are committed to positive interactions between all contributors of the project. To ensure this, please follow the Code of Conduct in all communications. Discuss problems, raise bugs and propose feature ideas \u2693\ufe0e We are happy you made it here! In case you want to share your feedback, need support, want to discuss issues from using Connaisseur in your own projects, have ideas for new features or just want to connect with us, please reach out via GitHub Discussions . If you want to raise any bugs you found or make a feature request, feel free to create an issue with an informative title and description. While issues are a great way to discuss problems, bugs and new features, a direct proposal via a pull request can sometimes say more than a thousand words. So be bold and contribute to the code as described in the next section ! In case you require a more private communication, you can reach us via connaisseur@securesystems.dev . Contribute to source code \u2693\ufe0e The following steps will help you make code contributions to Connaisseur and ensure good code quality and workflow. This includes the following steps: Set up your environment : Set up up your local environment to best interact with the code. Further information is given below . Make atomic changes : Changes should be atomic. As such, pull requests should contain only few commits, and each commit should only fix one issue or implement one feature, with a concise commit message. Test your changes : Test any changes locally for code quality and functionality and add new tests for any additional code. How to test is described below . Create semantic, conventional and signed commits : Any commits should follow a simple semantic convention to help structure the work on Connaisseur. The convention is described below . For security reasons and since integrity is at the core of this project, code merged into master must be signed. How we achieve this is described below . Create pull requests : We consider code review central to quality and security of code. Therefore, a pull request (PR) to the develop branch should be created for each contribution. It will be reviewed, and potential improvements may be discussed within the PR. After approval, changes will be merged and moved to the master branch with the next release. Set up the environment \u2693\ufe0e To start contributing, you will need to set up your local environment. First step is to get the source code by cloning this repository: git clone git@github.com:sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git In order to review the effects of your changes, you should create your own Kubernetes cluster and install Connaisseur. This is described in the getting started . A simple starting point may be a minikube cluster with e.g. a Docker Hub repository for maintaining your test images and trust data. In case you make changes to the Connaisseur container image itself or code for that matter, you need to re-build the image and install it locally for testing. This requires a few steps: In helm/values.yaml , set imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent . Configure your local environment to use the Kubernetes Docker daemon. In minikube, this can be done via eval (minikube docker-env) . Build the Connaisseur container image via make docker . Install Connaisseur as usual via make install . Test changes \u2693\ufe0e Tests and linting are important to ensure code quality, functionality and security. We therefore aim to keep the code coverage high. We are running several automated tests in the CI pipeline . Application code is tested via pytest and linted via pylint . When making changes to the application code, please directly provide tests for your changes. We recommend using black for autoformatting to simplify linting and reduce review effort. It can be installed via: pip3 install black To autoformat the code: black <path-to-repository>/connaisseur Changes can also be tested locally. We recommend the following approach for running pytest in a container: docker run -it --rm -v <path-to-repository>:/data --entrypoint=ash python:alpine cd data YARL_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 MULTIDICT_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 pip3 install -r requirements_dev.txt pytest --cov=connaisseur --cov-report=xml tests/ This helps identify bugs in changes before pushing. INFO We believe that testing should not only ensure functionality, but also aim to test for expected security issues like injections and appreciate if security tests are added with new functionalities. Besides the unit testing and before any PR can be merged, an integration test is carried out whereby: Connaisseur is successfully installed in a test cluster a non-signed image is deployed to the cluster and denied an image signed with an unrelated key is denied a signed image is deployed to the cluster and passed Connaisseur is successfully uninstalled You can also run this integration test on a local cluster. There is a more detailed guided on how to do that. If you are changing documentation, you can simply inspect your changes locally via: docker run --rm -it -p 8000 :8000 -v ${ PWD } :/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material Signed commits and pull requests \u2693\ufe0e All changes to the develop and master branch must be signed which is enforced via branch protection . This can be achieved by only fast-forwarding signed commits or signing of merge commits by a contributor. Consequently, we appreciate but do not require that commits in PRs are signed. A general introduction into signing commits can for example be found in the With Blue Ink blog . For details on setting everything up for GitHub, please follow the steps in the Documentation . Once you have generated your local GPG key, added it to your GitHub account and informed Git about it, you are set up to create signed commits. We recommend to configure Git to sign commits by default via: git config commit.gpgsign true This avoids forgetting to use the -S flag when committing changes. In case it happens anyways, you can always rebase to sign earlier commits: git rebase -i master You can then mark all commits that need to be signed as edit and sign them without any other changes via: git commit -S --amend --no-edit Finally, you force push to overwrite the unsigned commits via git push -f . Semantic and conventional commits \u2693\ufe0e For Connaisseur, we want to use semantic and conventional commits to ensure good readability of code changes. A good introduction to the topic can be found in this blog post . Commit messages should consist of header, body and footer. Such a commit message takes the following form: git commit -m \"<header>\" -m \"<body>\" -m \"<footer>\" The three parts should consist of the following: header : Comprises of a commit type (common types are described below) and a concise description of the actual change, e.g. fix: extend registry validation regex to custom ports . body (optional): Contains information on the motivation behind the change and considerations for the resolution, The current regex used for validation of the image name does not allow using non-default ports for the image repository name. The regex is extended to optionally provide a port number. . footer (optional): Used to reference PRs, issues or contributors and mark consequences such as breaking changes, e.g. Fix #<issue-number> We want to use the following common types in the header: build : changes to development and building ci : CI related changes docs : changes in the documentation feat : adding of new features fix : fixing an issue or bug refactor : adjustment of code base to improve code quality or performance but not adding a feature or fixing a bug test : testing related changes update : updating a dependency A complete commit message could therefore look as follows: git commit -m \"fix: extend registry validation regex to custom ports\" -m \"The current regex used for validation of the image name does not allow using non-default ports for the image repository name. The regex is extended to optionally provide a port number.\" -m \"Fix #3\" Enjoy! \u2693\ufe0e Please be bold and contribute!","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#contributing","text":"We hope to steer development of Connaisseur from demand of the community and are excited about direct contributions to improve the tool!

Create pull requests : We consider code review central to quality and security of code. Therefore, a pull request (PR) to the develop branch should be created for each contribution. It will be reviewed, and potential improvements may be discussed within the PR. After approval, changes will be merged and moved to the master branch with the next release.","title":"Contribute to source code"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#set-up-the-environment","text":"To start contributing, you will need to set up your local environment. First step is to get the source code by cloning this repository: git clone git@github.com:sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git In order to review the effects of your changes, you should create your own Kubernetes cluster and install Connaisseur. This is described in the getting started . A simple starting point may be a minikube cluster with e.g. a Docker Hub repository for maintaining your test images and trust data. In case you make changes to the Connaisseur container image itself or code for that matter, you need to re-build the image and install it locally for testing. This requires a few steps: In helm/values.yaml , set imagePullPolicy to IfNotPresent . Configure your local environment to use the Kubernetes Docker daemon. In minikube, this can be done via eval (minikube docker-env) . Build the Connaisseur container image via make docker . Install Connaisseur as usual via make install .","title":"Set up the environment"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#test-changes","text":"Tests and linting are important to ensure code quality, functionality and security. We therefore aim to keep the code coverage high. We are running several automated tests in the CI pipeline . Application code is tested via pytest and linted via pylint . When making changes to the application code, please directly provide tests for your changes. We recommend using black for autoformatting to simplify linting and reduce review effort. It can be installed via: pip3 install black To autoformat the code: black <path-to-repository>/connaisseur Changes can also be tested locally. We recommend the following approach for running pytest in a container: docker run -it --rm -v <path-to-repository>:/data --entrypoint=ash python:alpine cd data YARL_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 MULTIDICT_NO_EXTENSIONS=1 pip3 install -r requirements_dev.txt pytest --cov=connaisseur --cov-report=xml tests/ This helps identify bugs in changes before pushing. INFO We believe that testing should not only ensure functionality, but also aim to test for expected security issues like injections and appreciate if security tests are added with new functionalities. Besides the unit testing and before any PR can be merged, an integration test is carried out whereby: Connaisseur is successfully installed in a test cluster a non-signed image is deployed to the cluster and denied an image signed with an unrelated key is denied a signed image is deployed to the cluster and passed Connaisseur is successfully uninstalled You can also run this integration test on a local cluster.

Admission control, validators and image policy \u2693\ufe0e Connaisseur works as a mutating admission controller . It intercepts all CREATE and UPDATE resource requests for Pods , Deployments , ReplicationControllers , ReplicaSets , DaemonSets , StatefulSets , Jobs , and CronJobs and extracts all image references for validation. Validation relies on two core concepts: image policy and validators. A validator is a set of configuration options required for validation like the type of signature, public key to use for verification, path to signature data, or authentication. The image policy defines a set of rules which maps different images to those validators. This is done via glob matching of the image name which for example allows to use different validators for different registries, repositories, images or even tags. This is specifically useful when using public or external images from other entities like Docker's official images or different keys in a more complex development team. Note : Typically, the public key of a known entity is used to validate the signature over an image's content in order to ensure integrity and provenance. However, other ways to implement such trust pinning exist and as a consequence we refer to all types of trust anchors in a generalized form as trust roots . Using Connaisseur \u2693\ufe0e Some general administration tasks like deployment or uninstallation when using Connaisseur are described in this section. Requirements \u2693\ufe0e Using Connaisseur requires Git , some Kubernetes cluster, Helm and Docker (only for local setups) to be installed and set up. Get the code \u2693\ufe0e The Connaisseur source code can be cloned directly from GitHub and includes the application and Helm charts in a single repository: git clone https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git Configure \u2693\ufe0e The configuration of Connaisseur is completely done in the helm/values.yaml . The upper deployment section offers some general Kubernetes typical configurations like image version or resources. Specifically, the deployment.failurePolicy allows configuration whether the mutating admission webhook should fail closed ( Fail , default ) or open ( Ignore ) should the Connaisseur service become unavailable. While Connaisseur is configured to be secure by default, setting the failure policy to Ignore allows to prioritize cluster access 1 . The actual configuration consists of the validators and image policy sections. These are described in detail below and for initials steps it is instructive to follow the getting started guide . Other features are described on the respective pages . Connaisseur ships with a pre-configuration that does not need any adjustments for testing. However, validating your own images requires additional configuration. Deploy \u2693\ufe0e Install Connaisseur by using Helm: helm install connaisseur helm --atomic --create-namespace --namespace connaisseur This will install Connaisseur in its own namespace called connaisseur . The installation itself may take a moment, as the installation order of the Connaisseur components is critical. Only when the Connaisseur pods are up and running, the admission webhook can be applied for intercepting requests. Check \u2693\ufe0e Once everything is installed, you can check whether all the pods are up by running kubectl get all -n connaisseur : kubectl get all -n connaisseur > NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE > pod/connaisseur-deployment-78d8975596-42tkw 1 /1 Running 0 22s > pod/connaisseur-deployment-78d8975596-5c4c6 1 /1 Running 0 22s > pod/connaisseur-deployment-78d8975596-kvrj6 1 /1 Running 0 22s > > NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE > service/connaisseur-svc ClusterIP 10 .108.220.34 <none> 443 /TCP 22s > > NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE > deployment.apps/connaisseur-deployment 3 /3 3 3 22s > > NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE > replicaset.apps/connaisseur-deployment-78d8975596 3 3 3 22s Use \u2693\ufe0e To use Connaisseur, simply try running some images or apply a deployment. In case you use the pre-configuration, you could for example run the following commands: kubectl run demo --image = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:unsigned > Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request ( ... ) . kubectl run hello-world --image = docker.io/hello-world > pod/hello-world created Delete \u2693\ufe0e Just like for installation, Helm can also be used to delete Connaisseur from your cluster: helm uninstall connaisseur -n connaisseur In case uninstallation fails or problems occur during subsequent installation, you can manually remove all resources: kubectl delete all,mutatingwebhookconfigurations,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,configmaps,imagepolicies,secrets,serviceaccounts,customresourcedefinitions -lapp.kubernetes.io/instance = connaisseur kubectl delete namespaces connaisseur Connaisseur for example also installs a CutstomResourceDefinition imagepolicies.connaisseur.policy that validates its configuration. In case of major releases, the configuration structure might change which can cause installation to fail and you might have to delete it manually. Makefile \u2693\ufe0e Alternatively to using Helm, you can also run the Makefile for installing, deleting and more. Here the available commands: make install -- Runs the helm install command. make uninstall -- Switches the namespace to connaisseur , uses the helm uninstall command and deletes the connaisseur namespace. make annihilate -- Deletes all resources labeled with app.kubernetes.io/instance=connaisseur as well as the connaisseur namespace. This command is usually helpful, should the normal make uninstall not work. make docker -- Builds the connaisseur and connaisseur:helm-hook (relevant for installing Connaisseur) container images. Detailed configuration \u2693\ufe0e All configuration is done in the helm/values.yaml . The configuration of features is only described in the corresponding section . Validators \u2693\ufe0e The validators are configured in the validators field, which defines a list of validator objects. A validator defines what kind of signatures are to be expected, how signatures are to be validated, against which trust root and how to access the signature data. For example, images might be signed with Docker Content Trust and reside in a private registry. Thus the validator would need to specify notaryv1 as type, the notary host and the required credentials. The specific validator type should be chosen based on the use case. A list of supported validator types can be found here . All validators share a similar structure for configuration. For specifics and additional options, please review the dedicated page of the validator type. There is a special behavior, when a validator or one of the trust roots is named default . In this case, should an image policy rule not specify a validator or trust root to use, the one named default will be used instead. This also means there can only be one validator named default and for the trust roots, there can only be one called default within a single validator. Connaisseur comes with a few validators pre-configured including one for Docker's official images. The pre-configured validators can be removed. However to avoid Connaisseur failing its own validation in case you remove the securesystemsengineering_official key, make sure to also exclude Connaisseur from validation either via the static allow validator or namespaced validation . The special case of static validators used to simply allow or deny images without verification is described below. Configuration options \u2693\ufe0e .validators[*] in helm/values.yaml supports the following keys: Key Default Required Description name - Name of the validator, which is referenced in the image policy. It must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or '-'. If the name is default , it will be used if no validator is specified. type - Type of the validator, e.g. notaryv1 or cosign , which is dependent on the signing solution in use . trust_roots - List of trust anchors to validate the signatures against. In practice, this is typically a list of public keys. trust_roots[*].name - Name of the trust anchor, which is referenced in the image policy. If the name is default , it will be used if no key is specified. trust_roots[*].key - Value of the trust anchor, most commonly a PEM encoded public key. auth - Credentials that should be used in case authentication is required for validation. Details are provided on validator-specific pages. Further configuration fields specific to the validator type are described in the respective section . Example \u2693\ufe0e validators : - name : default type : notaryv1 host : notary.docker.io trust_roots : - name : default key : | -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEsx28WV7BsQfnHF1kZmpdCTTLJaWe d0CA+JOi8H4REuBaWSZ5zPDe468WuOJ6f71E7WFg3CVEVYHuoZt2UYbN/Q== -----END PUBLIC KEY----- auth : username : superuser password : lookatmeimjumping - name : myvalidator type : cosign trust_roots : - name : mykey key : | -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEIFXO1w6oj0oI2Fk9SiaNJRKTiO9d ksm6hFczQAq+FDdw0istEdCwcHO61O/0bV+LC8jqFoomA28cT+py6FcSYw== -----END PUBLIC KEY----- Static validators \u2693\ufe0e Static validators are a special type of validator that does not validate any signatures. Depending on the approve value being true or false , they either allow or deny all images for which they are specified as validator. This for example allows to implement an allowlist or denylist . Configuration options \u2693\ufe0e Key Default Required Description name - Name of the validator, which will be used to reference it in the image policy. type - static ; value has to be static for a static validator. approve - true or false to admit or deny all images. Example \u2693\ufe0e validators : - name : allow type : static approve : true - name : deny type : static approve : false Image policy \u2693\ufe0e The image policy is defined in the policy field and acts as a list of rule objects to determine which image should be validated by which validator (and potentially some further configurations). For each image in the admission request, only a single rule in the image policy will apply: the one with the most specific matching pattern field. This is determined by the following algorithm: A given image is matched against all rule patterns. All matching patterns are compared to one another to determine the most specific one (see below). Only two patterns are compared at a time; the more specific one then is compared to the next one and so forth. Specificity is determined as follows: Patterns are split into components (delimited by \"/\"). The pattern that has a higher number of components wins (is considered more specific). Should the two patterns that are being compared have equal number of components, the longest common prefix between each pattern component and corresponding image component are calculated (for this purpose, image identifiers are also split into components). The pattern with the longest common prefix in one component, starting from the leftmost, wins. Should all longest common prefixes of all components between the two compared patterns be equal, the pattern with a longer component, starting from the leftmost, wins. The rule whose pattern has won all comparisons is considered the most specific rule. Return the most specific rule. Should an image match none of the rules, Connaisseur will deny the request and raise an error. This deny per default behavior can be changed via a catch-all rule *:* and for example using the static allow validator in order to admit otherwise unmatched images. In order to perform the actual validation, Connaisseur will call the validator specified in the selected rule and pass the image name and potential further configuration to it. The reference to validator and exact trust root is resolved in the following way: The validator with name ( validators[*].name ) equal to the validator value in the selected rule is chosen. If no validator is specified, the validator with name default is used if it exists. Of that validator, the trust root (e.g. public key) is chosen which name ( .validators.trust_roots[*].name ) matches the policies trust root string ( with.trust_root ). If no trust root is specified, the trust root with name default is used if it exists. Let's review the pattern and validator matching at a minimal example. We consider the following validator and policy configuration (most fields have been omitted for clarity): validators : - name : default # validator 1 trust_roots : - name : default # key 1 key : | ... - name : myvalidator # validator 2 trust_roots : - name : default # key 2 key : | ... - name : mykey # key 3 key : | ... policy : - pattern : \"*:*\" # rule 1 - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/*:*\" # rule 2 validator : myvalidator - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/myimg:*\" # rule 3 validator : myvalidator with : trust_root : mykey Now deploying the following images we would get the matchings: docker.io/superrepo/myimg:v1 \u2192 rule 1 \u2192 validator 1 ( key 1 ): The image matches none of the more specific rules 2 and 3, so rule 1 is applied. As that rule neither specifies a validator nor a trust root, the default validator (validator 1) with trust root default (key 1) is used. docker.io/myrepo/superimg:v1 \u2192 rule 2 \u2192 validator 2 ( key 2 ): The image only matches rules 1 and 2 and thus 2 is chosen as it is more specific. That rule specifies myvalidator as validator but no trust root and thus validator 2 with trust root default (key 2) is used. docker.io/myrepo/myimg:v1 \u2192 rule 3 \u2192 validator 2 ( key 3 ): The image matches all rules and thus 3 is chosen as it is most specific. The rule specifies myvalidator as validator with mykey as trust root and thus validator 2 with key 2 is used. Connaisseur ships with a few rules pre-configured. There is two rules that should remain intact in some form in order to not brick the Kubernetes cluster: k8s.gcr.io : This is an allow rule for Kubernetes images ( k8s.gcr.io ) in order to not block cluster relevant images. These cannot be validated currently. docker.io/securesystemsengineering/*:* : This rule is used to validate the Connaisseur images with the respective validator and removal can break the Connaisseur deployment. It is, however, possible to use the static allow validator. Configuration options \u2693\ufe0e .policy[*] in helm/values.yaml supports the following keys: Key Default Required Description pattern - Globbing pattern to match an image name against. validator default Name of a validator in the validators list. If not provided, the validator with name default is used if it exists. with - Additional parameters to use for a validator. See more specifics in validator section . with.trust_root default Name of a trust root, which is specified within the referenced validator. If not provided, the trust root with name default is used if it exists. Example \u2693\ufe0e policy : - pattern : \"*:*\" - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/*:*\" validator : myvalidator with : trust_root : mykey - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/deniedimage:*\" validator : deny - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/allowedimage:v*\" validator : allow Common examples \u2693\ufe0e Let's look at some useful examples for the validators and policy configuration. These can serve as a first template beyond the pre-configuration or might just be instructive to understand validators and policies.

It intercepts all CREATE and UPDATE resource requests for Pods , Deployments , ReplicationControllers , ReplicaSets , DaemonSets , StatefulSets , Jobs , and CronJobs and extracts all image references for validation. Validation relies on two core concepts: image policy and validators. A validator is a set of configuration options required for validation like the type of signature, public key to use for verification, path to signature data, or authentication. The image policy defines a set of rules which maps different images to those validators. This is done via glob matching of the image name which for example allows to use different validators for different registries, repositories, images or even tags. This is specifically useful when using public or external images from other entities like Docker's official images or different keys in a more complex development team. Note : Typically, the public key of a known entity is used to validate the signature over an image's content in order to ensure integrity and provenance.

A validator defines what kind of signatures are to be expected, how signatures are to be validated, against which trust root and how to access the signature data.

Thus the validator would need to specify notaryv1 as type, the notary host and the required credentials. The specific validator type should be chosen based on the use case. A list of supported validator types can be found here . All validators share a similar structure for configuration. For specifics and additional options, please review the dedicated page of the validator type. There is a special behavior, when a validator or one of the trust roots is named default . In this case, should an image policy rule not specify a validator or trust root to use, the one named default will be used instead. This also means there can only be one validator named default and for the trust roots, there can only be one called default within a single validator. Connaisseur comes with a few validators pre-configured including one for Docker's official images. The pre-configured validators can be removed. However to avoid Connaisseur failing its own validation in case you remove the securesystemsengineering_official key, make sure to also exclude Connaisseur from validation either via the static allow validator or namespaced validation .

For each image in the admission request, only a single rule in the image policy will apply: the one with the most specific matching pattern field. This is determined by the following algorithm: A given image is matched against all rule patterns. All matching patterns are compared to one another to determine the most specific one (see below). Only two patterns are compared at a time; the more specific one then is compared to the next one and so forth. Specificity is determined as follows: Patterns are split into components (delimited by \"/\"). The pattern that has a higher number of components wins (is considered more specific). Should the two patterns that are being compared have equal number of components, the longest common prefix between each pattern component and corresponding image component are calculated (for this purpose, image identifiers are also split into components). The pattern with the longest common prefix in one component, starting from the leftmost, wins. Should all longest common prefixes of all components between the two compared patterns be equal, the pattern with a longer component, starting from the leftmost, wins. The rule whose pattern has won all comparisons is considered the most specific rule. Return the most specific rule. Should an image match none of the rules, Connaisseur will deny the request and raise an error. This deny per default behavior can be changed via a catch-all rule *:* and for example using the static allow validator in order to admit otherwise unmatched images. In order to perform the actual validation, Connaisseur will call the validator specified in the selected rule and pass the image name and potential further configuration to it. The reference to validator and exact trust root is resolved in the following way: The validator with name ( validators[*].name ) equal to the validator value in the selected rule is chosen. If no validator is specified, the validator with name default is used if it exists. Of that validator, the trust root (e.g. public key) is chosen which name ( .validators.trust_roots[*].name ) matches the policies trust root string ( with.trust_root ). If no trust root is specified, the trust root with name default is used if it exists. Let's review the pattern and validator matching at a minimal example. We consider the following validator and policy configuration (most fields have been omitted for clarity): validators : - name : default # validator 1 trust_roots : - name : default # key 1 key : | ... - name : myvalidator # validator 2 trust_roots : - name : default # key 2 key : | ... - name : mykey # key 3 key : | ... policy : - pattern : \"*:*\" # rule 1 - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/*:*\" # rule 2 validator : myvalidator - pattern : \"docker.io/myrepo/myimg:*\" # rule 3 validator : myvalidator with : trust_root : mykey Now deploying the following images we would get the matchings: docker.io/superrepo/myimg:v1 \u2192 rule 1 \u2192 validator 1 ( key 1 ): The image matches none of the more specific rules 2 and 3, so rule 1 is applied. As that rule neither specifies a validator nor a trust root, the default validator (validator 1) with trust root default (key 1) is used. docker.io/myrepo/superimg:v1 \u2192 rule 2 \u2192 validator 2 ( key 2 ): The image only matches rules 1 and 2 and thus 2 is chosen as it is more specific. That rule specifies myvalidator as validator but no trust root and thus validator 2 with trust root default (key 2) is used. docker.io/myrepo/myimg:v1 \u2192 rule 3 \u2192 validator 2 ( key 3 ): The image matches all rules and thus 3 is chosen as it is most specific. The rule specifies myvalidator as validator with mykey as trust root and thus validator 2 with key 2 is used. Connaisseur ships with a few rules pre-configured. There is two rules that should remain intact in some form in order to not brick the Kubernetes cluster: k8s.gcr.io : This is an allow rule for Kubernetes images ( k8s.gcr.io ) in order to not block cluster relevant images.

In case you have previously worked with Docker Content Trust or Cosign before and already possess key pairs, you can skip this step (how to retrieve a previously created DCT key is described here ). Otherwise, pick your preferred signing solution below. In case you are uncertain which solution to go with, you might be better off to start with DCT, as it comes packaged with docker . Cosign on the other hand is somewhat more straightforward to use. Docker Content Trust General usage of DCT is described in the docker documentation . For now, we just need to generate a public-private root key pair via: docker trust key generate root You will be prompted for a password, the private key is automatically imported and a root.pub file is created in your current folder that contains your public key which should look similar to: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- role: root MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAELDzXwqie/P66R3gVpFDWMhxOyol5 YWD/KWnAaEIcJVTYUR+21NJSZz0yL7KLGrv50H9kHai5WWVsVykOZNoZYQ == -----END PUBLIC KEY----- We will only need the actual base64 encoded part of the key later. Cosign Usage of Cosign is very well described in the docs . You can download Cosign from its GitHub repository . A keypair is generated via: cosign generate-key-pair You will be prompted to set a password, after which a private ( cosign.key ) and public ( cosign.pub ) key are created. In the next step, we will need the public key that should look similar to: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEvtc/qpHtx7iUUj+rRHR99a8mnGni qiGkmUb9YpWWTS4YwlvwdmMDiGzcsHiDOYz6f88u2hCRF5GUCvyiZAKrsA == -----END PUBLIC KEY----- Configure Connaisseur \u2693\ufe0e Now, we will need to configure Connaisseur. Let's first clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/sse-secure-systems/connaisseur.git cd connaisseur Connaisseur is configured via helm/values.yaml , so we will start there. We need to set Connaisseur to use our previously created public key for validation. To do so, go to the .validators and find the default validator. We need to uncomment the trust root with name default and add our previously created public key. The result should look similar to this: Docker Content Trust # the `default` validator is used if no validator is specified in image policy - name : default type : notaryv1 # or other supported validator (e.g. \"cosign\") host : notary.docker.io # configure the notary server to be used trust_roots : # the `default` key is used if no key is specified in image policy - name : default key : | # enter your key below -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAELDzXwqie/P66R3gVpFDWMhxOyol5 YWD/KWnAaEIcJVTYUR+21NJSZz0yL7KLGrv50H9kHai5WWVsVykOZNoZYQ== -----END PUBLIC KEY----- #cert: | # in case the trust data host is using a self-signed certificate # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- # ... # -----END CERTIFICATE----- #auth: # credentials in case the trust data requires authentication # # either (preferred solution) # secret_name: mysecret # reference a k8s secret in the form required by the validator type (check the docs) # # or (only for notaryv1 validator) # username: myuser # password: mypass Cosign In addition for Cosign, the type needs to be set to cosign and the host is not required. # the `default` validator is used if no validator is specified in image policy - name : default type : cosign # or other supported validator (e.g. \"cosign\") trust_roots : # the `default` key is used if no key is specified in image policy - name : default key : | # enter your key below -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEvtc/qpHtx7iUUj+rRHR99a8mnGni qiGkmUb9YpWWTS4YwlvwdmMDiGzcsHiDOYz6f88u2hCRF5GUCvyiZAKrsA== -----END PUBLIC KEY----- #cert: | # in case the trust data host is using a self-signed certificate # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- # ... # -----END CERTIFICATE----- #auth: # credentials in case the trust data requires authentication # # either (preferred solution) # secret_name: mysecret # reference a k8s secret in the form required by the validator type (check the docs) # # or (only for notaryv1 validator) # username: myuser # password: mypass We have now configured the validator default with trust root default . This will automatically be used if no validator and trust root is specified in the image policy ( .policy ). Per default, Connaisseur's image policy under .policy in helm/values.yaml comes with a pattern \"*:*\" that does not specify a validator or trust root and thus all images that do not meet any of the more specific pre-configured patterns will be verified using this validator. Consequently, we leave the rest untouched in this tutorial, but strongly recommend to read the basics to leverage the full potential of Connaisseur. Deploy Connaisseur \u2693\ufe0e So let's deploy Connaisseur to the cluster: helm install connaisseur helm --atomic --create-namespace --namespace connaisseur This can take a few minutes. You should be prompted something like: NAME: connaisseur LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jul 9 20 :43:10 2021 NAMESPACE: connaisseur STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None Afterwards, we can check that Connaisseur is running via kubectl get all -n connaisseur which should look similar to: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE pod/connaisseur-deployment-6876c87c8c-txrkj 1 /1 Running 0 2m9s pod/connaisseur-deployment-6876c87c8c-wvr7q 1 /1 Running 0 2m9s pod/connaisseur-deployment-6876c87c8c-rnc7k 1 /1 Running 0 2m9s NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT ( S ) AGE service/connaisseur-svc ClusterIP 10 .152.183.166 <none> 443 /TCP 2m10s NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE deployment.apps/connaisseur-deployment 3 /3 3 3 2m9s NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE replicaset.apps/connaisseur-deployment-6876c87c8c 3 3 3 2m9s Test Connaisseur \u2693\ufe0e Now that we created our key pairs, configured and deployed Connaisseur, the next step is to test our setup. So let's create and push a test image. Feel free to use our simple test Dockerfile under tests/Dockerfile (make sure to set your own IMAGE name): # Typically, IMAGE=<REGISTRY>/<REPOSITORY-NAME>/<IMAGE-NAME>:<TAG>, like IMAGE = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/demo:test docker build -f tests/Dockerfile -t ${ IMAGE } . docker push ${ IMAGE } In case you have DCT turned on per default via environment variable DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 , you should disable for now during the docker push by adding the --disable-content-trust=true . If we try to deploy this unsigned image: kubectl run test --image = ${ IMAGE } Connaisseur denies the request due to lack of trust data or signed digest, e.g.: Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request: Unable to get root trust data from default. # or Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request: No trust data for image \"docker.io/securesystemsengineering/demo:test\" . # or Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request: could not find signed digest for image \"docker.io/securesystemsengineering/demo:test\" in trust data. So let's sign the image and try again. Docker Content Trust In DCT signing works via docker push using the --disable-content-trust flag: docker push ${ IMAGE } --disable-content-trust = false You will be prompted to provide your password and might be asked to set a new repository key. The trust data will then be pushed to the Docker Hub Notary server. Cosign For Cosign, we use the private key file from the first step: cosign sign -key cosign.key ${ IMAGE } You will be asked to enter your password after wich the signature data will be pushed to your repository. After successful signing, we try again: kubectl run test --image = ${ IMAGE } Now, the request is admitted to the cluster and Kubernetes returns: pod/test created You did it you just verified your first signed images in your Kuberenetes cluster Read on to learn how to fully configure Connaisseur Cleanup \u2693\ufe0e To uninstall Connaisseur, use: helm uninstall connaisseur --namespace connaisseur Uninstallation can take a moment as Connaisseur needs to validate the deletion webhook.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#getting-started","text":"This guide offers a simple default configuration for setting up Connaisseur using public infrastructure and verifying your first self-signed images.

Each of the STRIDE threats were matched to all entities relevant to Connaisseur, including Connaisseur itself. A description of how a threat on an entity manifests itself is given as well as a possible counter measure. images created by monkik from Noun Project (1) Developer/User \u2693\ufe0e Threat Description Counter Measure Spoofing A developer could be tricked into signing a malicious image, which subsequently will be accepted by Connaisseur. Security Awareness: Developers need to be aware of these attacks, so they can spot any attempts. Elevation of privilege An attacker could acquire the credentials of a developer or trick her into performing malicious actions, hence elevating their privileges to those of the victim. Depending on the victim's privileges, other attacks may be mounted. RBAC & Security Awareness: With proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), the effects of compromising an individual's account would help limit its impact and may mitigate the privilege escalation, of course depending on the victim's access level. Other than that, a security awareness training for developers can help minimize the chances of losing critical credentials. (2) Connaisseur service \u2693\ufe0e Threat Description Counter Measure Spoofing An attacker could stop the original Connaisseur service and start their own version, to take over the admission controller's responsibilities. That way, the functionality of Connaisseur could be completely disabled or altered at will. RBAC: By only permitting a carefully selected group of people to start and stop services in the Connaisseur namespace, such attacks can be prevented. Tampering Given an attacker has access to the Connaisseur container, she could tamper with its source code, leading to forged responses or full compromise. The attacker could also stop the the original Connaisseur process and handle incoming requests some other way, which would be similar to the spoofing threat, but from inside the Connaisseur container. RBAC + Monitoring: Access to the inside of the container can be restricted with RBAC, so an attacker never gets there in the first place. In case the attacker already is inside the container, there are specific monitoring tools (e.g. falco ), which are able to register changes inside containers and notify you, should Connaisseur be compromised. Tampering An attacker could modify Connaisseur's image policy to bypass signature verification and inject malicious images. Alternatively, the public root key could be replaced, allowing fake trust data to pass as legit. Lastly, the admission controller could be simply deactivated by deleting the webhook. RBAC + Monitoring: An RBAC system can prevent unauthorized changes to both the image policy and public root key. Additionally, the Connaisseur readiness probe checks the availability of the webhook and will be set to Not Ready should the webhook not be present. Monitoring should still be used to keep track of the admission controller's webhook availability status, as setting up a fake connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel pod in the connaisseur namespace can bypass that readiness probe check. More on that in an upcoming architectural decision record. Denial of service When sending an extraordinary amount of requests to Connaisseur or triggering unexpected behavior, Connaisseur might become unresponsive or crash. As a result, image signatures can't be verified. Failure Policy: The webhook that is connected to Connaisseur denies all request automatically, should the Connaisseur service be unavailable. Thus, malicious images cannot enter the cluster. Additionally, multiple instances of Connaisseur can be run for better load balancing. Elevation of privilege Since Connaisseur interacts with the Kubernetes API, an attacker located inside the Connaisseur container can act on its behalf and use its permissions. RBAC: Per default, the Connaisseur service account only has read permissions to a few non-critical objects. (3) Notary server \u2693\ufe0e Threat Description Counter Measure Spoofing An attacker could mount a Monster-in-the-Middle attack between Notary and the Connaisseur service and act as a fake Notary, sending back false trust data. TLS: A TLS connection between Connaisseur and Notary ensures the Notary server's authenticity. Tampering With full control over the Notary server, the stored trust data can be manipulated to include digests of malicious images. Signatures: Changing the trust data would invalidate the signatures and thus fail the image verification. Additionally, the keys needed to create valid signatures are not stored in Notary, but offline on client side. Information disclosure As Notary is responsible for creating the snapshot and timestamp signatures, an attacker could steal those private keys, and create valid snapshot and timestamp signatures. Key rotation: The snapshot and timestamp keys can easily be rotated and changed frequently. The more cirtical root and target key are not stored on server side. Denial of service An extraordinary amount of requests to the Notary server could bring it down so that the Connaisseur service has no more trust data available to work with. Health Probe: Connaisseur's readiness and liveness probes check the Notary server's health every few seconds. Should Notary be unavailable, Connaisseur will switch into a not-ready state. As a consequence, the failure policy will automatically deny all requests. (4) Registry \u2693\ufe0e Threat Description Counter Measure Spoofing An attacker could mount a Monster-in-the-Middle attack between the registry and the Kubernetes cluster and act as a fake registry, sending back malicious images. TLS: A TLS connection between the Kubernetes cluster and the registry ensures that the registry is authentic. Tampering With full control over the registry, an attacker may introduce malicious images or change the layers of existing ones and thus inject malicious content. Image Digests: Introducing new images does not work as Connaisseur selects them by digest. An attacker would have to change the content of the corresponding digest layer, while the changes need to produce the same digest. Such a hash collision is considered practically impossible. If digests differ, the docker daemon underlying the cluster will deny the image.

Context \u2693\ufe0e Connaisseur's main components are a MutatingWebhookConfiguration and the Connaisseur Pods. The MutatingWebhookConfiguration intercepts requests to create or update Kubernetes resources and forwards them to the Connaisseur Pods tasked, on a high level, with verifying trust data. The order of deploying both components matters, since a blocking MutatingWebhookConfiguration without the Connaisseur Pods to answer its requests would also block the deployment of said Pods. In #3 it was noted that prior to version 1.1.5 of Connaisseur when looking at the Ready status of Connaisseur Pods, they could report Ready while being non-functional due to the MutatingWebhookConfiguration missing. However, as stated above the MutatingWebhookConfiguration can only be deployed after the Connaisseur Pods, which was solved by checking the Ready state of said Pods. If one were to add a dependency to this Ready state, such that it only shows Ready when the MutatingWebhookConfiguration exists, we run into a deadlock, where the MutatingWebhookConfiguration waits for the Pods and the Pods wait for the MutatingWebhookConfiguration. Considered options \u2693\ufe0e Option 1 \u2693\ufe0e At the start of the Helm deployment, one can create a Pod named connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel that will run for 5 minutes (which is also the installation timeout by Helm). Connaisseur Pods will report Ready if they can 1) access notary AND 2) the MutatingWebhookConfiguration exists OR 3) the connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel Pod is still running. If 1) AND 2) both hold true, the sentinel is killed even if the 5 minutes have not passed yet. Option 2 \u2693\ufe0e Let Connaisseur's Pod readiness stay non-indicative of Connaisseur functioning and advertise that someone running Connaisseur has to monitor the MutatingWebhookConfiguration in order to ensure proper working. Option 3 \u2693\ufe0e Deploy MutatingWebhookConfiguration through Helm when Connaisseur Pods are healthy instead of when ready. Require Pod started and working notary connection for health and require additionally the existence of the MutatingWebhookConfiguration for readiness. Decision outcome \u2693\ufe0e We chose option 1 over option 2, because it was important to us that a brief glance at Connaisseur's Namespace allows one to judge whether it is running properly. Option 3 was not chosen as the readiness status of Pods can be easily seen from the Service, whereas the health status would require querying every single Pod individually. We deemed that to be a very ugly, non-kubernetes-y solution and hence decided against it. Positive consequences \u2693\ufe0e If the Connaisseur Pods report Ready during the connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel 's runtime, the MutatingWebhookConfiguration will be deployed by Helm. Otherwise, the Helm deployment will fail after its timeout period (default: 5min), since there won't be a running connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel Pod anymore that resolves the installation deadlock. The Connaisseur Pods will never reach the Ready state and the MutatingWebhookConfiguration never gets deployed. This means, we get consistent deployment failures after the inital waiting period if something did not work out. Additionally, if the MutatingWebhookConfiguration gets removed for whatever reason during operation, Connaisseur Pods will be failing, indicating their failed dependency. Hence, monitoring the Connaisseur Pods is sufficient to ensure their working. Negative consequences \u2693\ufe0e On the other hand, if an adversary can deploy a Pod named connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel to Connaisseur's Namespace, the Connaisseur Pods will always show Ready regardless of the MutatingWebhookConfiguration. However, if an adversary can deploy to Connaisseur's Namespace, chances are Connaisseur can be compromised anyways. More importantly, if not a single Connaisseur Pod is successfully deployed or if the notary healthcheck fails during the sentinel's lifetime, then the deployment will fail regardless of possible recovery at a later time. Another issue would be the connaisseur-bootstrap-sentinel Pod being left behind, however since it has a very limited use case we can also clean it up during the deployment, so apart from the minimal additional complexity of the deployment this is a non-issue.","title":"ADR 1: Bootstrap Sentinel"},{"location":"adr/ADR-1_bootstrap-sentinel/#adr-1-bootstrap-sentinel","text":"","title":"ADR 1: Bootstrap Sentinel"},{"location":"adr/ADR-1_bootstrap-sentinel/#status","text":"Amended in ADR-3 .","title":"Status"},{"location":"adr/ADR-1_bootstrap-sentinel/#context","text":"Connaisseur's main components are a MutatingWebhookConfiguration and the Connaisseur Pods.

Unfortunately this is rather impractical, as one doesn't create all signatures for all images one uses in a cluster. There is a need to access signature data from multiple places, like in a setup where most images come from a private registry + notary and some from Docker Hub and their notary. There is also the problem that a single notary instance could use multiple root keys, used for creating the signatures, like in the case of Docker Hub. Connaisseur also only supports a single root key to be trust pinned, thus making it impractical. That's why the decision was made to support more than one notary and multiple keys per notary, which leads to the question how the new configuration should look like. This also has implications on the notary health check, which is important for Connaisseur's own readiness check. Considered options \u2693\ufe0e Choice 1 \u2693\ufe0e The overall notary configuration setup in helm/values.yaml . Option 1 (Per Notary) \u2693\ufe0e The notary field becomes a list and changes to notaries . Per to be used notary instance, there will be one entry in this list. The entry will have the following data fields ( bold are mandatory): name -- A unique identifier for the notary configuration, which will be used in the image policy. host -- The host address of the notary instance. pub_root_keys -- A list of public root keys, which are to be used for signature verification. name -- An identifier for a single public root key, which will be used in the image policy. key -- The actual public root key in PEM format. selfsigned_cert -- A self-signed certificate in PEM format, for making secure TLS connection to the notary. auth -- Authentication details, should the notary require some. user -- Username to authenticate with. password -- Password to authenticate with. secretName -- Kubernetes secret reference to use INSTEAD of user/password combination. is_acr -- Marks the notary as being part of an Azure Container Registry. The image policy will have two additional fields per rule entry (in \"quotes\" are already present fields): \" pattern \" -- Image pattern to match against, for rule to apply. \" verify \" -- Whether the images should be verified or not. \" delegations \" -- List of required delegation roles. notary -- Which notary to use for any matching image. This has to correspond to a name field of one configured notary. What happens if none is given, is defined by the result of choice 2. key -- Which key to use for doing the signature verification. This has to correspond to a name field of one of the public keys configured for the notary corresponding to the image policy's notary field. What happens if none is given, is defined by the result of choice 2. Option 2 (Per Notary + Key) \u2693\ufe0e The notary field becomes a list and changes to notaries . Per notary + public root key combination, there is one entry. Meaning, for example, there will be one entry for Docker Hub and the public key for all official images and there will be another entry for Docker Hub and the public key for some private images. The entries will look identical to the one's from option 1, with two exceptions. The pub_root_keys field of the notary configurations won't be a list and only has a single entry, without needing to specify a key name. The image policy will only address the notary configuration to be chosen with the notary field, without the need for a key field. Choice 2 \u2693\ufe0e Default values for notary (and key ) inside the image policy. Option 1 (First item) \u2693\ufe0e When no notary is specified in a image policy rule, the first entry in the notaries configuration list is taken. The same goes for the public root key list, should option 1 for choice 1 be chosen. Problem: Might get inconsistent, should list ordering in python get shuffled around Option 2 (Explicit default) \u2693\ufe0e One of the notary configuration will be given a default field, which marks it as the default value. Problem: No real problems here, just an extra field that the user has to care about. Option 3 (Mandatory Notary) \u2693\ufe0e The notary (and potentially key ) field is mandatory for the image policy. Problem: Creates configuration overhead if many image policies use the same notary/key combination. Option 4 (Default name) \u2693\ufe0e If no notary or key are given in the image policy, it is assumed that one of the elements in the notary list or key list has name: \"default\" , which will then be taken. Should the assumption be wrong, an error is raised. Choice 3 \u2693\ufe0e Previously, the readiness probe for connaisseur also considered the notary's health for its own status. With multiple notary instances configured, this behavior changes. Option 1 (Ignore Notary) \u2693\ufe0e The readiness probe of Connaisseur will no longer be dependent on any notary health checks. The are completely decoupled. Problem: No knowledge that Connaisseur will automatically fail because of an unreachable notary, before one tries to deploy an image. Option 2 (Health check on all) \u2693\ufe0e In order for connaisseur to be ready, all configured notaries must be healthy and reachable. Problem: A single unreachable notary will \"disable\" Connaisseur's access to all others. Option 3 (Log Notary status) \u2693\ufe0e A mix of option 1 and 2, whereas the readiness of Connaisseur is independent of the notaries health check, but they are still being made, so unhealthy notaries can be logged. Problem: At what interval should be logged? Decision outcome \u2693\ufe0e Choice 1 \u2693\ufe0e Option 1 was chosen, to keep configurational duplication at a minimum. Choice 2 \u2693\ufe0e Option 4 was chosen. If more than one notary configuration or key within a configuration are present, one of those can be called \"default\" (setting the name field). That way it should be obvious enough, which configuration or key will be used, if not further specified within the image policy, while keeping configuration effort low. Choice 3 \u2693\ufe0e Option 3 was chosen. Notary and Connaisseur will be completely decoupled, with Connaisseur logging all notaries it can't reach. This way Connaisseur can still be operational, even with all notaries being unreachable. Otherwise Connaisseur would have blocked even images that were allowlisted. This is a breaking change, but we agreed that it is better as it allows e.g. deployments for which the respective image policy specifies verify: false .","title":"ADR 3: Multiple Notary Configuration"},{"location":"adr/ADR-3_multi_notary_config/#adr-3-multiple-notary-configuration","text":"","title":"ADR 3: Multiple Notary Configuration"},{"location":"adr/ADR-3_multi_notary_config/#status","text":"Accepted","title":"Status"},{"location":"adr/ADR-3_multi_notary_config/#context","text":"Previously Connaisseur only supported the configuration of a single notary, where all signature data had to reside in.

The least required fields a validator needs are a name for later referencing and a type for knowing its correct kind. validators : - name : \"dockerhub-nv2\" type : \"notaryv2\" ... - name : \"harbor-nv1\" type : \"notaryv1\" host : \"notary.harbor.io\" root_keys : - name : \"default\" key : \"...\" - name : \"cosign\" type : \"cosign\" ... Depending on the type, additional fields might be required, e.g. the notaryv1 type requires a host and root_keys field. NB: JSON schema validation works for the above and can easily handle various configurations based on type in there. Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with this structure ( option 1.1.1.1 ) due to the lack of other alternatives. It provides all needed information and the flexibility to use multiple validation methods, as needed. 1.1.2 Sensitive values \u2693\ufe0e If we allow multiple validators that may contain different forms of sensitive values, i.e. notary credentials, symmetric keys, service principals, ..., they need to be properly handled within the Helm chart with respect to ConfigMaps and Secrets. Currently, the distinction is hard-coded. Option 1.1.2.1 \u2693\ufe0e Add an optional sensitive([-_]fields) field at the validator config top level. Any sensitive values go in there and will be handled by the Helm chart to go into a secret. Any other values are treated as public and go into the ConfigMap. Advantages: - Generic configuration - Could be used by potential plugin validators to have their data properly handled (potential future) - Hard to forget the configuration for newly implemented validators Disadvantage: If implemented in a config = merge(secret, configmap) way, might allow sensitive values in configmap and Connaisseur still working Option 1.1.2.2 \u2693\ufe0e Hard-code sensitive values based on validator type Advantages: Can do very strict validation on fields without extra work Disadvantages: - Helm chart change might be forgotten for new validator - Helm chart release required for new validator - Does not \"natively\" allow plugins Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with option 1.1.2.2 and hard code the sensitive fields, to prevent users from misconfigure and accidentally but sensitive parts into configmaps. Image policy (1.2) \u2693\ufe0e For the image policy similar changes to the notary configuration have to be made. Proposition \u2693\ufe0e The previous notary field in the image policy will be changed to validator , referencing a name field of one item in the validators list. Any additional fields, e.g. required delegation roles for a notaryv1 validator will be given in a with field. This will look similar to this: policy : - pattern : \"docker.harbor.io/*:*\" validator : \"harbor-nv1\" with : key : \"default\" delegations : - lou - max - pattern : \"docker.io/*:*\" validator : \"dockerhub-nv2\" Option 1.2.1.1 \u2693\ufe0e Besides the self configured validator, two additional validators will be available: allow and deny . The allow validator will allow any image and the deny validator will deny anything. Advantages: More powerful than verify flag, i.e. has explicit deny option. Disadvantages: More config changes for users Option 1.2.1.2 \u2693\ufe0e Stick with current verify flag. Advantages: Config known for current users Disadvantages: No explicit deny option Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with option 1.2.1.1 , as we don't have to use additional fields and offer more powerful configuration options. Option 1.2.2.1 \u2693\ufe0e When no validator given, default to deny validator. Advantages: Easy Disadvantages: Not explicit Option 1.2.2.2 \u2693\ufe0e Require validator in policy config. Advantages: Explicit configuration, no accidental denying images Disadvantages: ? Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with option 1.2.2.1 as it reduces configurational effort and is consistent with the key selection behavior. Option 1.2.3.1 \u2693\ufe0e The validators from option 1.2.1.1 ( allow and deny ) will be purely internal, and additional validator can not be named \"allow\" or \"deny\". Advantages: Less configurational effort Disadvantage: A bit obscure for users Option 1.2.3.2 \u2693\ufe0e The allow and deny validator will be added to the default configuration as type: static with an extra argument (name up for discussion) that specifies whether everything should be denied or allowed. E.g.: validators : - name : allow type : static approve : true - name : deny type : static approve : false - ... Advantages: No obscurity, if user don't need these they can delete them. Disadvantage: Bigger config file ...? Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with option 1.2.3.2 as we favor less obscurity over the \"bigger\" configurational \"effort\". Validator interface (Choice 2) \u2693\ufe0e See validator interface Should validation return JSON patch or digest? Option 2.1.1 \u2693\ufe0e Validator.validate creates a JSON patch for the k8s request. Hence, different validators might make changes in addition to transforming tag to digest. Advantages: More flexibility in the future Disadvantages: We open the door to changes that are not core to Connaisseur functionality Option 2.1.2 \u2693\ufe0e Validator.validate returns a digest and Connaisseur uses the digest in a \"standardized\" way to create a JSON patch for the k8s request. Advantage: No code duplication and we stay with core feature of translating input data to trusted digest Disadvantages: Allowing additional changes would require additional work if we wanted to allow them in the future Decision \u2693\ufe0e We are going with option 2.1.2 as all current and upcoming validation methods return a digest.","title":"ADR 4: Modular Validation"},{"location":"adr/ADR-4_modular/#adr-4-modular-validation","text":"","title":"ADR 4: Modular Validation"},{"location":"adr/ADR-4_modular/#status","text":"Accepted","title":"Status"},{"location":"adr/ADR-4_modular/#context","text":"With the upcoming of notaryv2 and similar projects like Cosign the opportunity for Connaisseur arises to support multiple signing mechanisms, and combine all into a single validation tool.

Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a client implementation by Docker to manage such trust data for container images like signing images or verifying the corresponding signatures. It is part of the standard Docker CLI ( docker ) and for example provides the docker trust commands. Using DCT, the trust data is per default pushed to the Notary server associated to the container registry. However, not every public container registry provides an associated Notary server and thus support for DCT must be checked for the provider in question. Docker Hub for example, runs an associated Notary server (notary.docker.io) and even uses it to serve trust data for the Docker Official Images . In fact, since Connaisseur's pre-built images are shared via the Connaisseur Docker Hub repository , its own trust data is maintained on Docker Hub's Notary server. Besides the public Notary instances, Notary can also be run as a private or even standalone instance. Harbor for example comes along with an associated Notary instance. Validating a container image via DCT requires a repository's public root key as well as fetching the repository's trust data from the associated Notary server. While DCT relies on trust on first use (TOFU) for repositories' public root keys, Connaisseur enforces manual pinning to a public root key that must be configured in advance. Basic usage \u2693\ufe0e In order to validate signatures using Notary, you will either need to create signing keys and signed images yourself or extract the public root key of other images and configure Connaisseur via validators[*].trust_roots[*].key in helm/values.yaml to pin trust to those keys. Both is described below. However, there is also step-by-step instructions for using Notary in the getting started guide . Creating signing key pairs \u2693\ufe0e You can either create the root key manually or push an image with DCT enabled upon which docker will guide you to set up the keys as described in the next section. In order to generate a public-private root key pair manually, you can use: docker trust key generate root You will be prompted for a password, the private key is automatically imported and a root.pub file is created in your current folder that contains your public key which should look similar to: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- role: root MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAELDzXwqie/P66R3gVpFDWMhxOyol5 YWD/KWnAaEIcJVTYUR+21NJSZz0yL7KLGrv50H9kHai5WWVsVykOZNoZYQ == -----END PUBLIC KEY----- You will only need the actual base64 encoded part for configuring the validators[*].trust_roots[*].key in helm/values.yaml of Connaisseur to validate your images. How to extract the public root key for any image is described below . Creating signatures \u2693\ufe0e Before you can start validating images using the Notary (V1) validator, you'll first need an image which has been signed using DCT. Easiest way to do this is by pushing an image of your choice (e.g. busybox:stable ) to your Docker Hub repository with DCT activated (either set the environment variable DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1 or use the --disable-content-trust=false flag). If you haven't created any signatures for images in the current repository yet, you'll be asked to enter a passphrase for a root key and targets key, which get generated on your machine. Have a look into the TUF documentation to read more about TUF roles and their meanings. If you already have these keys, just enter the required passphrase. DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = 1 docker push <your-repo>/busybox:stable > The push refers to repository [ <your-repo>/busybox ] > 5b8c72934dfc: Pushed > stable: digest: sha256:dca71257cd2e72840a21f0323234bb2e33fea6d949fa0f21c5102146f583486b size: 527 > Signing and pushing trust metadata > You are about to create a new root signing key passphrase.

Private keys reside in ~/.docker/trust/private and public trust data is added to ~/.docker/trust/tuf/ . The created signature for your image is pushed to the public Docker Hub Notary (notary.docker.io). The private keys and password are required whenever a new version of the image is pushed with DCT activated. Getting the public root key \u2693\ufe0e Signature validation via Connaisseur requires the public root key to verify against as a trust anchor. But from where do you get this, especially for public images whose signatures you didn't create? We have created the get_root_key utility to extract the public root key of images. To use it, either use our pre-built image or build the docker image yourself via docker build -t get-public-root-key -f docker/Dockerfile.getRoot . and run it on the image to be verified: # pre-built docker run --rm docker.io/securesystemsengineering/get-public-root-key -i securesystemsengineering/testimage # or self-built docker run --rm get-public-root-key -i securesystemsengineering/testimage > KeyID: 76d211ff8d2317d78ee597dbc43888599d691dbfd073b8226512f0e9848f2508 > Key: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- > MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEsx28WV7BsQfnHF1kZmpdCTTLJaWe > d0CA+JOi8H4REuBaWSZ5zPDe468WuOJ6f71E7WFg3CVEVYHuoZt2UYbN/Q == > -----END PUBLIC KEY----- The -i ( --image ) option is required and takes the image, for which you want the public key. There is also the -s ( --server ) option, which defines the Notary server that should be used and which defaults to notary.docker.io . The public repository root key resides with the signature data in the Notary instance, so what the get_root_key utility does in the background is just fetching, locating and parsing the public repository root key for the given image. Configuring and running Connaisseur \u2693\ufe0e Now that you either created your own keys and signed images or extracted the public key of other images, you will need to configure Connaisseur to use those keys for validation. This is done via validators in helm/values.yaml . The corresponding entry should look similar to the following (using the extracted public key as trust root): - name : customvalidator type : notaryv1 host : notary.docker.io trust_roots : - name : default key : | # THE DESIRED PUBLIC KEY BELOW -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEOXYta5TgdCwXTCnLU09W5T4M4r9f QQrqJuADP6U7g5r9ICgPSmZuRHP/1AYUfOQW3baveKsT969EfELKj1lfCA== -----END PUBLIC KEY----- You also need to create a corresponding entry in the image policy via policy in helm/values.yaml , for example: - pattern : \"docker.io/<REPOSITORY>/<IMAGE>:*\" # THE DESIRED REPOSITORY validator : customvalidator After installation, you are ready to verify your images against your public key: helm install connaisseur helm --atomic --create-namespace --namespace connaisseur Connaisseur now rejects all images from the given repository that have not been signed based on the provided public key. A quick guide for installation and testing is available in getting started . It also provides a full step-by-step guide. Understanding validation \u2693\ufe0e Using the simple pre-configuration shipped with Connaisseur, it is possible to test validation by deploying some pods: kubectl run test-signed --image = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:signed > pod/test-signed created kubectl run test-unsigned --image = docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:unsigned > Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request: Unable to find signed digest for image docker.io/securesystemsengineering/testimage:unsigned. # or in case of a signature with a different key > Error from server: admission webhook \"connaisseur-svc.connaisseur.svc\" denied the request: Failed to verify signature of trust data root. How does Connaisseur validate these requests and convert the images with tags to digests? What happens in the background is that Connaisseur looks up trust data of the image in the root , snapshot , timestamp and targets files (in json format) by querying the API of the Notary server. Trust data syntax is validated against their known schemas and the files' signatures are validated against their respective public keys. The pinned root key is used for the root.json file that in turn contains the other keys which can then be trusted for validation of the remaining trust data ( snapshot.json , timestamp.json , targets.json ). Furthermore, Connaisseur gathers trust data of potential delegations linked in the targets file which can then be used to enforce delegations . At this point, Connaisseur is left with a validated set of trust data. Connaisseur filters the trust data for consistent signed digests that actually relate to the image under validation. In case exactly one trusted digest remains, Connaisseur modifies the admission request and admits it. Otherwise, admission is rejected. While it is obvious to reject an image that does not exhibit a trusted digest, there is the special case of multiple trusted digests. This only occurs in some edge cases, but at this point Connaisseur cannot identify the right digest anymore and consequently has to reject. For more information on TUF roles, please refer to TUF's documentation or checkout this introductory presentation on how the trust data formats work and are validated by Connaisseur. Configuration options \u2693\ufe0e .validators[*] in helm/values.yaml supports the following keys for Notary (V1) (refer to basics for more information on default keys): Key Default Required Description name - See basics . type - notaryv1 ; the validator type must be set to notaryv1 . host - URL of the Notary instance, in which the signatures reside, e.g. notary.docker.io . trust_roots[*].name - See basics . trust_roots[*].key - See basics .

To better understand this feature, it's best to have a basic understanding of the TUF key hierarchy, or more specifically the purpose of the root, targets and delegation keys. If you are more interested in this topic, please read the TUF documentation . When creating the signatures of your docker images earlier, two keys were generated -- the root key and the targets key. The root key is the root of all trust and will be used whenever a new image repository is created and needs to be signed. It's also used to rotate all other kinds of keys, thus there is usually only one root key present. The targets key is needed for new signatures on one specific image repository, hence every image repository has its own targets key. Hierarchically speaking, the targets keys are below the root key, as the root key can be used to rotate the targets keys should they get compromised. Delegations will now go one level deeper, meaning they can be used to sign individual image repositories and only need the targets key for rotation purposes, instead of the root key. Also delegation keys are not bound to individual image repositories, so they can be re-used multiple times over different image repositories. So in a sense they can be understood as keys for individual signers. To create a delegation key run: docker trust key generate <key-name> > Generating key for <key-name>... > Enter passphrase for new <key-name> key with ID 9deed25: > Repeat passphrase for new <key-name> key with ID 9deed25: > Successfully generated and loaded private key. Corresponding public key available: <current-directory>/<key-name>.pub This delegation key now needs to be added as a signer to a respective image repository, like the busybox example above . In doing so, you'll be asked for the targets key. docker trust signer add --key <key-name>.pub <key-name> <your-repo>/busybox > Adding signer \"<key-name>\" to <your-repo>/busybox... > Enter passphrase for repository key with ID b0014f8: > Successfully added signer: <key-name> to <your-repo>/busybox If you create a new signature for the image, you'll be asked for your delegation key instead of the targets key, therefore creating a signature using the delegation. > DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = 1 docker push <your-repo>/busybox:stable Without further configuration, Connaisseur will accept all delegation signatures for an image that can ultimately be validated against the public root key. Connaisseur can enforce a certain signer/delegation (or multiple) for an image's signature via the with.delegations list inside an image policy rule. Simply add the signer's name to the list. You can also add multiple signer names to the list in which case Connaisseur will enforce that all delegations must have signed a matching image. policy : - pattern : \"<your-repo>/busybox:*\" with : delegations : - <key-name> - <other-key-name> The delegation feature can be useful in complex organisations where certain people may be required to sign specific critical images. Another use case is to sign an image with delegation keys in various stages of your CI and enforce that certain checks were passed, i.e. enforcing the signature of your linter, your security scanner and your software lisence compliance check. Using Azure Container Registry \u2693\ufe0e Using Azure Container Registry (ACR) must be specified in the validator configuration by setting is_acr to true . Moreover, you need to provide credentials of an Azure Identity having at least read access to the ACR (and, thus, to the associated Notary instance). Assuming you have the az cli installed you can create a Service Principal for this by running: # Retrieve the ID of your registry REGISTRY_ID = $( az acr show --name <ACR-NAME> --query 'id' -otsv ) # Create a service principal with the Reader role on your registry az ad sp create-for-rbac --name \"<SERVICE-PRINCIPLE-NAME>\" --role Reader --scopes ${ REGISTRY_ID } Use the resulting applicationID as auth.username , the resulting password as auth.password and set <ACR>.azurecr.io as host in the helm/values.yaml and you're ready to go! Notary does traditionally not carry the version number. However, in differentiation to the new Notary V2 project we decided to add a careful \"(V1)\" whenever we refer to the original project. \u21a9","title":"Notary (V1) / DCT"},{"location":"validators/notaryv1/#notary-v1-dct","text":"Notary (V1 1 ) works as an external service holding signatures and trust data of artifacts based on The Update Framework (TUF) . Docker Content Trust (DCT) is a client implementation by Docker to manage such trust data for container images like signing images or verifying the corresponding signatures. It is part of the standard Docker CLI ( docker ) and for example provides the docker trust commands. Using DCT, the trust data is per default pushed to the Notary server associated to the container registry. However, not every public container registry provides an associated Notary server and thus support for DCT must be checked for the provider in question. Docker Hub for example, runs an associated Notary server (notary.docker.io) and even uses it to serve trust data for the Docker Official Images . In fact, since Connaisseur's pre-built images are shared via the Connaisseur Docker Hub repository , its own trust data is maintained on Docker Hub's Notary server. Besides the public Notary instances, Notary can also be run as a private or even standalone instance. Harbor for example comes along with an associated Notary instance. Validating a container image via DCT requires a repository's public root key as well as fetching the repository's trust data from the associated Notary server. While DCT relies on trust on first use (TOFU) for repositories' public root keys, Connaisseur enforces manual pinning to a public root key that must be configured in advance.","title":"Notary (V1) / DCT"},{"location":"validators/notaryv1/#basic-usage","text":"In order to validate signatures using Notary, you will either need to create signing keys and signed images yourself or extract the public root key of other images and configure Connaisseur via validators[*].trust_roots[*].key in helm/values.yaml to pin trust to those keys.

You can download Cosign from its GitHub repository . In short: After installation, a keypair is generated via: cosign generate-key-pair You will be prompted to set a password, after which a private ( cosign.key ) and public ( cosign.pub ) key are created. You can then use Cosign to sign a container image using: # Here, ${IMAGE} is REPOSITORY/IMAGE_NAME:TAG cosign sign -key cosign.key ${ IMAGE } The created signature can be verfied via: cosign verify -key cosign.pub ${ IMAGE } To use Connaisseur with Cosign, configure a validator in helm/values.yaml with the generated public key ( cosign.pub ) as a trust root.
